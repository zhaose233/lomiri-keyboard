# Ubuntu Keyboard

This is a QML and C++ based Keyboard Plugin for Maliit, based on the Maliit Reference plugin, taking into account the special UI/UX requests of Ubuntu Phone.

## Updating presage language models

If the source material used for presage's prediction models is update the databases can be regenerated by running "make lang_db_$lc" within the plugin's "src" directory (where $lc is the language code for the updated language, e.g. "make lang_db_en" for English)

## Updating translations

After building the keyboard (such as with `dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc`), run `make pot` from the `po` directory to rebuild the translation source file.
